			Swift flap. Eager and hungry, dripping with forward focus,<br>
			you stitched yourself along the bridge<br>
			to reach, to stand not upon but above, the peak and its shimmer,<br>
			wild wonderer, risking a lullaby,<br>
			and stayed there, hiding just to peer into the waters, the original ultramarine<br>
			where spectral, sponge-tinged turtles<br>
			were rising from the blue<br><br>
			There the taut static of nature at its lowest,<br>
			humming, veering frequencies,<br>
			baseless declarations!<br><br>
			
			A great gasp of your forearms,<br>
			a laugh, at you, but nice <br>
			absorbing the liminal, moving the pause. <br><br>
			Steps forward- a train- sleeping so fast.<br><br>
			A puzzling finesse, <br>
			How could you help falling out of yourself
			on such a lust for the colour of glass----<br>
			you, involuntary normals, imagined concrete,<br>
			a burning light, wax refuses to budge<br>
			in the face of the overeager, the endearing greed<br>
			of wanting the moon in the day and the sun in the night<br<br>
			<br><br>&loz; <br><br>
